# timesaveR

My daily work mostly entails running the same data cleaning, pre- and post-processing functions over and over again. For months and months. Years. 

This rough R package includes a collections of functions doing the completely different things, their only common denominator is: they save me time.

## Acknowledgements 

While some of the functions have been developed 100% by me, others are liberal (or not so liberal) adaptations of other people's work, several of whom I had lost track. I am happy to include attribution whenever I can: if you spot your or someone else's work, please let me know.
