\description{
Estimate the contribution of additive genetic (A), shared (C) and individual-specific 
environment (E) effects on traits variations, using a classical twin design study. 
It fits ACE, and the most parsimonious AE, CE e E model, which are then compared using 
the Akaikeâ€™s information criterion (AIC).
